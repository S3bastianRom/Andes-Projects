# üìÇ Backend with Python - Project repositories

Welcome to my project's repository for Andes University. This repository contains projects related to the **Backend with Python** course.

## üìå Table of Contents
The course has been divided into different modules to cover different areas of expertise in Python, here we can see a brief summary of the whole structure, if you want to have a deep dive into each module, feel free to click in each module to see its content


1. üë®üèª‚Äçüíª [Module 1](./Modulo1/)
    
    Foundations, in this module, the main focus was the understanding and fostering the programming logic, starting with basic operations going all the way up to OOP, including functions, each session had its own project so everything was practiced.

    * [Project 1](./Modulo1/Project1/)
        **| Basic operations**
    * [Project 2](./Modulo1/Project2/)
        **| User defined functions**
    * [Project 3](./Modulo1/Project3/)
        **| Object oriented programming - Foundations**
    * [Project 4](./Modulo1/Project4/)
        **| Object oriented programming - Intermediate**
    * [Module project](./Modulo1/Proyecto%20-%20Modulo1/)
        **| Module project**

        In this module project we focus on the implementation of an ice cream store, based on the OOP paradigm, All interfaces, classes, and methods have been implemented, this allows us to reuse code through inheritance and method calls, demonstrating the advantages of this structure.


2. üåê [Module 2](./Modulo2/)
    
    With a solid grasp of programming logic, we took the next step by introducing Flask. This versatile library, used in everything from small projects to large applications, helped us understand web development through the MVC design pattern, organizing software into structured layers.

    * [Project 1 - Part 1](./Modulo2/Project1_Part1/)
        **| Flask Basic structure**
    * [Project 1 - Part 2](./Modulo2/Project1_Part2/)
        **| Flask and MVC design pattern**
    * [Project 2 - Part 1](./Modulo2/Project2_Part1/)
        **| SQL**
    * [Project 2 - Part 2](./Modulo2/Project2_Part2/)
        **| Flask app**
