# 📂 Backend with Python - Project repositories

Welcome to my project's repository for Andes University. This repository contains projects related to the **Backend with Python** course.

## 📌 Table of Contents
The course has been divided into different modules to cover different areas of expertise in Python, here we can see a brief summary of the whole structure, if you want to have a deep dive into each module, feel free to click in each module to see its content


1. 👨🏻‍💻 [Module 1](./Modulo1/)
    
    Foundations, in this module, the main focus was the understanding and fostering the programming logic, starting with basic operations going all the way up to OOP, including functions, each session had its own project so everything was practiced.

    * [Project 1](./Modulo1/Project1/)
        **| Basic operations**
    * [Project 2](./Modulo1/Project2/)
        **| User defined functions**
    * [Project 3](./Modulo1/Project3/)
        **| Object oriented programming - Foundations**
    * [Project 4](./Modulo1/Project4/)
        **| Object oriented programming - Intermediate**
    * [Module project](./Modulo1/Proyecto%20-%20Modulo1/)
        **| Module project**

        In this module project we focus on the implementation of an ice cream store, based on the OOP paradigm, All interfaces, classes, and methods have been implemented, this allows us to reuse code through inheritance and method calls, demonstrating the advantages of this structure.


2. 🌐 [Module 2](./Modulo2/)
    
    With a solid grasp of programming logic, we took the next step by introducing Flask. This versatile library, used in everything from small projects to large applications, helped us understand web development through the MVC design pattern, organizing software into structured layers.

    * [Project 1 - Part 1](./Modulo2/Project1_Part1/)
        **| Flask Basic structure**
    * [Project 1 - Part 2](./Modulo2/Project1_Part2/)
        **| Flask and MVC design pattern**
    * [Project 2 - Part 1](./Modulo2/Project2_Part1/)
        **| SQL**
    * [Project 2 - Part 2](./Modulo2/Project2_Part2/)
        **| Flask app**
    * [Project 3](./Modulo2/Project3_Part1/)
        **| Testing and errors**
    * [Module project](./Modulo2/Project%20-%20Module2/)
        **| Module project**

        With this project we moved the ice cream store to a web application that'll allow to sale ice cream checking the product availability and testing each one of the methods at the same time registering all the ingredients, sales and general information into a MySQL database leveraging the MVC model to ensure consistency, maintanibility and clean code.

3. 🐍 [Module 3](./Modulo3/)

    Once acquired the solid basis on the MVC and the OOP paradigm, we moved to a higher stage of Flask, leveraging its features, such as authentication, authorization, API's, endpoints with blueprints in order to create clean and maintanable code also we learned about the scalability and segurity. 

    * [Project 1](./Modulo3/Project1/)
        **| Authentication and authorization**
    * [Project 2](./Modulo3/Project2/)
        **| API REST**
    * [Module project](./Modulo3/Project%20-%20Module3/)
        **| Module project**

        As part of the improvements that the ice cream store would need for the future in this module project we added a layer of security with authentication and authorization to keep the data and processes safe, we also added the API REST endpoints that are going to give a JSON as an output which third party apps can use.
